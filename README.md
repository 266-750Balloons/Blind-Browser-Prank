# Blind-Browser-Prank
A simple Chrome extension to confuse people about how blind they are by adding a CSS blur filter of varying degrees.

The blur is limited so that the browser is still usable most of the time. To add to the fun, the blur only shows up 50% of the time so that when the user reloads, the blur will probably be gone.

##Usage
1. Make sure your victim is very chill and not doing anything important.
  1. Good example: A person who mainly browses the web for fun or simple news.
  2. Bad Example: A Busy Person Working From Home.
  3. Just use common sense. If you were them, would you like it?
2. (Optional, but suggested for prank magic) Raise your right hand and say:
  * I pledge with all my vital organs that I will not abuse this software in any way or else will... I don't know. Some sort of implication? That's up to you.
3.  Download the repo with git or download a zip and extract it.
4. Go to chrome://extensions, turn on developer mode, click "Add Unpacked Extension", and select the folder of the repo.
5. Laugh at your friend/wait for the end of all humanity.
6. Let your friend know at some point about the prank, preferably before doomsday.
